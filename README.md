Lexicon Generation for Kazakh Language Using Python

1. Task Description:
 
This task involves generating a lexicon for the Kazakh language based on a corpus of tokenized and lemmatized sentences. Each token in the corpus has been annotated with part-of-speech tags and morphological features. The objective is to process this input data using Python, specifically leveraging data classes provided by Pydantic, to produce a JSON file containing information for each lemma. This information includes:

Part of speech label and morphological features
Total frequency count for the lemma
Total frequency count for each wordform associated with the lemma

2. Solution Overview:
The provided code effectively addresses the task requirements as outlined in the task description. It comprises the following steps:

3. Step 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing

Import the necessary libraries: json, nltk, string, and pandas.
Download Kazakh stopwords using NLTK.
Define a Pydantic data class named TokenData to represent token information, which includes lemma, part of speech (POS) label, morphological features, and wordform.
Load the JSON data containing tokenized and annotated sentences from the provided file.
Initialize lists to store instances of TokenData.



4. Step 2: Data Aggregation and JSON Output


Iterate through the sentences and tokens in the input data.
For each token, verify if the lemma is not a Kazakh stopword and the text is not punctuation.
Create instances of TokenData for valid tokens and append them to the token_instances list.
Convert the list of TokenData instances to a pandas DataFrame.
Group the DataFrame by lemma to calculate the total frequency count for each lemma.
Group the DataFrame by lemma and wordform to calculate the wordform frequency counts.
Merge the lemma frequency and wordform frequency data to create an output DataFrame.
Convert the output DataFrame to a JSON structure that includes lemma information, wordform frequency information, and total frequency.
Print the JSON structure to the console.
Write the generated JSON output to a file named 'output.json'.
Running the Solution
To run the solution:

Ensure that you have the required packages (json, nltk, pandas, and pydantic) installed in your Python environment.
Download the provided sample_parsed_sentences.json file and update the file path in the code accordingly.
Run the code in a Python environment.

5. Production Environment:

For a production environment, consider deploying the code on cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Services such as AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions offer serverless execution, while AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage can be used to store input and output data. These cloud platforms provide scalability, reliability, and easy deployment of Python code.

6. Additional Considerations:

Ensure that the input JSON file adheres to the specified format in the task description.
Implement error handling to address potential exceptions, such as missing keys or invalid input data.
Optimize the code for efficiency when dealing with large datasets.
GitHub Repository
The code and documentation for this solution can be shared in a public GitHub repository for accessibility and collaboration purposes.

By following these steps, the provided code effectively processes the input data, generates the required JSON output, and meets the task's requirements as described in the task details.
